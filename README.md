Movie Search App

This is a movie search app using react-hooks, react-router and context API. I've used OMDB API to fetch the movies data. You can search a movie in the search bar and if results match then you will get the related movies else you will get an error message. You can also click on a movie poster to get detailed information about the movie such as release year, duration, director, etc.
